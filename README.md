# SafeContracts: Your Shield in the DeFi World.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

SafeContracts is a pioneering decentralized security solution that empowers users and developers to confidently navigate the complex DeFi landscape. 

By combining human expertise with cutting-edge AI, we provide a comprehensive suite of tools to assess, verify, and rate the security of smart contracts. 

Our platform mitigates the risk of financial loss and exploits, fostering a more secure and trustworthy DeFi ecosystem.

SafeContracts is a decentralized managed security service deployed on the BNB Smart Chain, designed to mitigate the pervasive risk of interacting with malicious smart contracts. By combining human intelligence and advanced AI, we provide a robust, multi-faceted approach to smart contract security assessment.

### Problem Solved

- The decentralized nature of the blockchain, while offering unprecedented financial freedom, also introduces significant security challenges. 
- Malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts, leading to substantial financial losses for users. 
- SafeContracts addresses this critical issue by providing a robust, multi-layered security framework.
-  Our platform empowers users to make informed decisions by offering transparent security assessments, simplifies the onboarding process through social login integration, and incentivizes participation in secure DeFi ecosystems through staking rewards. This is built using <h6>WalletConnect, Safe protocol kit, Coinbase OnRamp and 1inch Network </h6>
- By establishing a trust-building mechanism with digital trust certificates, SafeContracts is at the forefront of creating a safer and more secure DeFi environment.

### How it works
- Our platform leverages a community-driven vetting process, enabling users to flag potentially unsafe contracts. 
- Simultaneously, our proprietary AI model scrutinizes contract code, alongside real-time on-chain asset valuations derived from 1inch's aggregated portfolio data. 
- This comprehensive analysis yields a security rating between 1 and 10, quantifying contract risk.
- To foster seamless user onboarding and interaction, we offer social login integration, allowing users to create smart accounts linked to their existing digital identities. 
- Contracts achieving stringent safety benchmarks through both community and AI evaluation are eligible for staking, incentivizing participation in a secure DeFi ecosystem. 
- Our whitelisting mechanism further solidifies trust by issuing digital trust certificates to verified contracts, enhancing transparency and accountability within the decentralized landscape.
